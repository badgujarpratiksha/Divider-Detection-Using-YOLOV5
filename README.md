# Divider-Detection-Using-YOLOV5


## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for detecting dividers in images using YOLOV5. The YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm is utilized to identify dividers within an image. Dividers can be various objects such as lines, fences, or other separators in a scene.

## Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
- YOLOV5: You can download the pre-trained weights and configuration files from [YOLO official website](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/). Make sure to follow the instructions for setting up YOLO.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/divider-detection-YOLOV5.git
   cd divider-detection-YOLOV5
